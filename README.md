# Horiseon Marketing Agency Website

## About

The Horiseon Marketing Agency website is designed to inform visitors about digital marketing services and their benefits. It provides important information about services such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. This webpage was neccessary to create as due to the developments in technology, most marketing and promotions are proving to be more effective than live or even television marketing via adverts. The project allows companies to not fall behind and make the most of new age technology. creating this project, I learnt how to put things into practice and was able to recognise how tiny changes to the codebase can create unmissable disturbances to the webpage. This project is unique as it doesn't overwhelm visitors through it's design and doesn't contain too much text on the front page.
